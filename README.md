# R-Fama-French-three-factor-model

Capital asset pricing model (generally known as capm) is arguably the most widely used model in finance area, however some criticize 
that the assumption is too simple and ideal. One of the improved version is the three factors model proposed by Fama & French.

In this project, I randomly choose three firms from existing data, run both Fama-French three factor model and capm in R, and evaluate the difference and explanatory power of the results.

Also check whether the problems of collinearity, serial correlation, heteroskedasticity occur.
